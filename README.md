# Why am I doing this?
This is a project I was set to do by the trainers in the bootcamp I started in the summer of 2021
# How I expect this challenge to go?
I expect it to go well as I will not be doing anything that I have not done before.
# What went well? What didn't go as planned?
Making the Game Entity and the controller went very well.
# Possible improvements
